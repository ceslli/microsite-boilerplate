This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Then, rename the file `.env.example` to `.env.local` and add the values for the Contentful CMS environment variables.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

To run the unit tests:

```
npm run test
```

To run the E2E tests, start the static app by running `npm run build && npm run start` or just run the development server.

Then run:

```
npm run cypress:open
```
